## Description
This project involves the development of a web platform that receives, processes, and stores images
transmitted via MQTT from an ESP32-CAM. It includes features like user authentication, device management,
camera control, image processing, and OTA firmware updates for connected devices. The platform allows
users to manage devices, adjust camera settings, process images, and download results, all through
an intuitive web interface.
